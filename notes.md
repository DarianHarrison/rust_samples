# 1. Getting Started

a) Install
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
restart shell
```
rustup update
rustc --version
```

b) cargo
```
cargo --version
cargo new hello_cargo
cd hello_cargo

cat << 'EOF' > Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
EOF
```
```
cargo check # run cargo check periodically to make sure it compiles, (does not compile code)
cargo update # update pachages in Cargo.toml
cargo run # to compile and run
```
Production Build
```
cargo build --release # compile it with optimizations
```

# 2. Guessing Game
```
cd 2.guessing_game
cargo run # to compile and run
```

# 3. Common Programming Concepts

todo: this chapter has some work to do, will fix in retrospective
notice we are quieting unused_code and other warnings just for demo's sake

```
cd 3.programming_concepts

rustc -A warnings vars_and_mutability
rustc -A warnings data_types
rustc -A warnings functions
rustc -A warnings control_flow
```

# 4. Ownership

todo: this chapter has some work to do, will fix in retrospective

```
cd 4.ownership

rustc -A warnings ownership_basics
rustc -A warnings references_borrowing
rustc -A warnings slice_type
```

# 5. Structs

A struct is like an objectâ€™s data attributes

```
cd 5.structs

rustc -A warnings 1.structs_basics.rs
rustc -A warnings 2.structs_example.rs
rustc -A warnings 3.method_syntax.rs
```


# 6. Enums and Pattern Matching

A better alternative of struct. We can represent concepts in a more concise manner by putting data directly into each enum variant. ipv4 ipv6 example
